# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository contains the compilation of my class projects for Public Health Sciences 34500 (PBHS 34500), Machine Learning for Public Health. The course was taken in Spring 2025 at the University of Chicago and was taught by Eric Polley, Ph.D.

These projects were designed primarily to exercise and develop skills rather than to advance a specific research question conceptually.

- **Project 1:** Used the `ncbirths` dataset to estimate predictors of low birthweight with Elastic Net and Random Forest models.  
- **Project 2:** Used data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to estimate predictors with Elastic Net logistic regression and Random Forest models.  
- **Project 3:** Used the provided dataset in class, `dataset3` to estimate predictors with Random Forests and a Super Learner ensemble approach.  
- **Project 4:** Used the `Chicago_air_quality.csv` and `dataset3` datasets to estimate predictors and compare a series of regularized regression models.
